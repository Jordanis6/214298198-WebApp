      <header>What I Learned this Semester</header>
      <p> This semester, let's take a moment to appreciate the journey we're about to embark on - learning HTML and CSS. Sure, at first glance, it might seem like we're just diving into the world of coding, but there's so much more to it. HTML and CSS aren't just languages; they're the building blocks of the web, the tools that empower us to craft beautiful, functional websites from scratch.</p>

        <p>
          Learning web development opens doors to a world of creative possibilities! I have gained the skills to build websites and applications that can inform, entertain, and connect people. It involves mastering languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but the journey is rewarding.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             I have learned that Web development is crucial in today's digital world. Businesses need a strong online presence to reach customers, showcase their products or services, and establish brand authority.
            </li>
            <li>
              Web development skills are in high demand. As more aspects of our lives move online, the need for skilled developers to create and maintain websites and web applications is constantly growing.

        <article>
            <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of web pages. It provides the structure and basic content, defining headings, paragraphs, images, and links. While it's not a programming language, it allows you to organize and format information displayed on websites. Every website you visit is built upon an HTML skeleton!</p>
  
            <ul>
              <li>
                Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN, develops HTML as part of the World Wide Web project. The goal was to create a system for researchers to easily share and access information.
              </li>
              <li>2000s: Focus shifts towards semantic elements, better accessibility, and separation of concerns with CSS.</li>

              <li>2014: HTML5 is released as a major revision, significantly expanding capabilities with features like video, audio, canvas elements, and offline storage.</li>
              <li>Present Day: HTML continues to evolve with new features and specifications being added regularly, focusing on improved user experience, interactivity, and integration with other web technologies.

      <p>
        The Backbone of the Web: Every website you visit is built upon an HTML foundation. It's the essential building block that structures the content you see on webpages. Learning HTML is a fundamental skill for aspiring web developers. It provides a strong foundation for understanding how web pages work and opens doors to learning CSS (styling) and JavaScript (interactivity) to create dynamic and engaging web experiences. HTML is a widely used and standardized language, ensuring that web pages can be interpreted and displayed consistently across different browsers and devices.

        <li>HTML provides the foundation for web pages by defining elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and tables. It separates the content from the presentation (styling), allowing for cleaner and more maintainable code.</li>

      <header>Basic CSS</header>
      <article>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language used to style and present the content written in HTML. Here are some basic CSS concepts to get you started:
      </article>
      <ul>
        <li>These target the HTML elements you want to style. There are different types of selectors:
Element Selector: Targets a specific HTML element by its tag name (e.g., h1, p, div).
Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class name (e.g., .important, .highlight).
ID Selector: Targets a unique element with a specific ID (e.g., #banner, #footer).</li>
        <li>Properties and Values:
          Properties define the aspect of an element you want to style (e.g., color, font-size, background-color).
          Values define how you want to style that property (e.g., red, 16px, #f0f0f0).</li>
        <li>Stylesheets:
          External stylesheets are separate CSS files (.css) linked to your HTML file. This keeps your HTML clean and organized.
          Inline styles can be applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute, but this is generally not recommended for larger projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>CSS concepts</header>
      <p>Beyond the basics, CSS offers a rich set of features to control the appearance and behavior of web pages. Here's a deeper dive into some advanced CSS concepts:</p>


      <ul>
        <li> Positioning:

          Static (default): Elements maintain their normal position in the document flow.
          Relative: Element is positioned relative to its normal position.
          Absolute: Element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned based on its containing element or the viewport.
          Fixed: Element is positioned relative to the viewport and remains fixed even as the user scrolls.</li>
        <li> Layout Techniques:

          Float: Allows elements to float to the left or right of the page content, with text wrapping around them.
          Flexbox: A powerful layout model for creating flexible and responsive layouts with ease.
          Grid: Another powerful layout model providing a two-dimensional grid system for precise and structured layouts.</li>
        <li>Preprocessors (like SASS or LESS): Extend CSS with features like variables, mixins, and nesting for more maintainable code.
          CSS Frameworks (like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS): Provide pre-built styles and components to jumpstart your web development process.</li>
      </ul>

    <section class="main-section" id="Five">
      <header>git basic commands</header>
      <p>While the essential commands provide a solid foundation, Git offers a robust set of features for more complex version control scenarios.</p>

      <ul>
        <li> git add <file>: This command adds a specific file to the staging area. The staging area is like a holding zone where you tell Git which changes you want to include in the next commit.</li>
        <li> git commit -m "<message>": This command captures the current state of the staged files as a commit. The <message> argument is a brief description of the changes you made. Descriptive commit messages are crucial for understanding your project history.</li>
        <li>git clone <url>: This command clones an existing Git repository from a remote hosting service like GitHub or GitLab to your local machine.</li>
