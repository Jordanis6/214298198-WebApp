      <p> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
        It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
        (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
        objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
        them.</p>

        <p>
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

              <li>
                A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web

              </li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>
                Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try
                one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.

        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
        different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
        does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
        JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
        and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
        renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

        <li>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</li>
        <li>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</li>
        <li>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</li>
      </ul>

      <header>Hello world</header>
      <article>
        To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
        your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
        <code
          >function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
          greetMe("World");
        </code>

        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!
      </article>
      <ul>
        <li>The classic "Hello, world!" program is a fundamental introduction to programming. It's a basic program that simply outputs the text "Hello, world!" to the screen. Its purpose is to demonstrate the most basic functionality of a programming language, like printing text. This program is often used as a starting point for beginners to learn the syntax and structure of a programming language.</li>
        <li>In a broader sense, "Hello, world!" also serves as a test to verify your development environment setup. It ensures that your compiler, interpreter, or any other tools needed to run code are correctly installed and configured. Seeing the expected output confirms that your environment is ready to execute more complex programs.</li>
        <li>"Hello, world!" has become a symbolic tradition in the programming community. It's a familiar starting point for learning a new language and a way for programmers to connect with others who share a passion for coding. It's a simple yet significant milestone in any programmer's journey.</li>

      <header>Declaring variables</header>
      <p>This section covers advanced topics and troubleshooting techniques. If you encounter any issues, refer to this section for guidance.</p>


      <ul>
        <li>With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</li>
        <li> By simply assigning it a value. For example,
            <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
            generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
            variant.</li>
        <li>With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
            syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
            Variable scope below.</li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Five">
      <header>Variable scope</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

      <ul>
        <li> When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.</li>
        <li> JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
            scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
            function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
            example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
            function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
            block, which in this case is an if statement.</li>
        <li>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
            ECMAScript 2015.</li>
